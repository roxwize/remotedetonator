# Remote Detonator

...is a [Better Than Adventure](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/3106066-better-than-adventure-for-beta-1-7-3-timely) mod
that provides a remote detonator that, when armed, lets you remotely ignite TNT from a distance of up to 128 blocks
away. To use it, right-click on a TNT block, back up a bit, then right click again on another block to ignite the
explosive.

To craft a remote detonator:

```

```

where `S` is a **steel ingot** and `R` is **redstone dust**.
